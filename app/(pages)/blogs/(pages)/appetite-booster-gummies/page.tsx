          Why Do Kids Lose Their Appetite?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Children go through all kinds of growth phases&mdash;and during some
          of them, their hunger levels can drop. It might be due to:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Rapid growth spurts</li>
          <li>Low activity levels</li>
          <li>Digestive issues</li>
          <li>Fussy eating habits</li>
          <li>Mild nutrient deficiencies</li>
          <li>Even stress or change in routine</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          The good news? A little extra support goes a long way&mdash;and
          that&apos;s exactly what our gummies are designed for.
