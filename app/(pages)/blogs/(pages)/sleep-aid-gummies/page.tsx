          We&apos;ve all been there&mdash;tossing, turning, checking the clock
          (again), and wishing for just one night of deep, uninterrupted sleep.
          In a world full of deadlines, distractions, and stress, restful sleep
          can feel like a luxury.
          <br />
          That&apos;s where our Sleep Aid Gummies come in. Thoughtfully
          formulated with gentle, natural ingredients, they help calm your mind
          and guide you into deep, peaceful sleep&mdash;without the grogginess.

          Why Gummies Work (and Why You&apos;ll Love Them)
        </h2>
        <p>
          Let&apos;s face it: choking down capsules before bed isn&apos;t
          exactly relaxing. Our gummies are:
        </p>
        <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
          <li>Easy to take, even after a long day</li>
          <li>Non-habit forming and free from harsh chemicals</li>
          <li>Gentle on your system and great for travel</li>
          <li>Naturally flavored and lightly sweetened</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          They help you unwind naturally&mdash;so you wake up refreshed, not
          groggy.
        </p>

          How to Use Them: Your Wind-Down Just Got Easier
        </h2>
        <p>
          Take 1&ndash;2 gummies 30 minutes before bed. Pair them with a
          relaxing bedtime routine&mdash;like reading, meditating, or dimming
          the lights&mdash;for best results.
          <br />
          You&apos;ll be amazed how quickly &quot;just one gummy&quot; becomes
          your favorite part of the day.
